# ship-pr

> When this skill is loaded, output "ws-ship-pr loaded."

**Entry check:** Follow [`config-resolution.md`](../ws-shared/config-resolution.md) § Entry check.

Ship from the resolved PR **head** to `config.project.baseBranch`: prepare board → push/create PR via configured SCM → wait for CI → `ws-goal-fix-pr` → merge when clean. Standalone: head defaults to `config.project.workingBranch`. Workflow (`workflowMode: true` with readable `{us-dir}` state): head is `state.branch`. Never rewrite `config.project.workingBranch`.

## SCM Independence & Configuration

`ws-ship-pr` is **SCM-provider independent**. It reads `{sharedDir}/config.json` at runtime to determine the active SCM platform and dispatch the corresponding provider skill:

- **`providers.scm: "github"`** → dispatches [`ws-github-provider`](../ws-github-provider/SKILL.md) (`gh` CLI / GitHub REST API)
- **`providers.scm: "azure-devops"`** (or `"ado"`) → dispatches [`ws-azure-devops-provider`](../ws-azure-devops-provider/SKILL.md) (`az repos` / ADO REST API)
- **`providers.scm: "local"`** → dispatches [`ws-local-spec-provider`](../ws-local-spec-provider/SKILL.md)

Prepare board (mandatory): [PREPARE-CHECKLIST.md](PREPARE-CHECKLIST.md). Wait/converge timing: [GOAL-OVERRIDES.md](GOAL-OVERRIDES.md). Examples: [examples.md](examples.md).

## Invocation

Standalone:

```
/ship-pr [commit-title] [base=<branch>] [head=<branch>] [dry-run] [no-merge] [skip-gates] [max <n>]
```

Workflow: `ws-spec-to-pr` Step 8 or `ws-spec-to-pr-lite` Step 4. Dispatched with `workflowMode: true`, `shipAction`, and typically `stopBeforeFixPr: true`: create/push PR and STOP; orch Step 9 runs `ws-goal-fix-pr`/`fix-pr`.

| Parameter | Default | Notes |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| `commit-title` | (optional) | Message for any uncommitted changes |
| `base` | `config.project.baseBranch` | Auto-detect `main`/`master` if unset |
| `head` | Standalone: `config.project.workingBranch` (`develop`). Workflow: `state.branch` when `{us-dir}` state is readable. | Standalone: branch to push and use as PR head; explicit `head=` overrides default. Workflow: ignored — always `state.branch`. |
| `dry-run` | `false` | Simulate; no commits/push/real PR API calls |
| `no-merge` | `false` | Create PR and run checks; stop before merge |
| `skip-gates` | `false` | Sets `skipQualityGates: true` — see § Quality gate bypass |
| `max <n>` | `10` | `ws-goal-fix-pr` iteration cap (ignored when `stopBeforeFixPr`) |
| `workflowMode` | `false` | Orchestrator-set: execute `shipAction` without re-asking |
| `shipAction` | (orchestrator-selected) | `create-pr` \| `push-only` \| `skip` |
| `stopBeforeFixPr` | `false` | Skip Step 6; orchestrator owns fix-PR at Step 9 |
| `skipQualityGates` | `false` | Orchestrator-set from `--skip-gates` or `config.json` → `invariants.skipQualityGates` |

Before executing, restate commit title, resolved PR head (`shipHead`), base, SCM provider (read from `config.json`), mode, `skipQualityGates`, `stopBeforeFixPr`, max, and `shipAction`. When `skipQualityGates` is active, prefix banners with **`[GATES BYPASSED]`**. Resolve base branch and provider from `{sharedDir}/config.json`; resolve `shipHead` per § PR head resolution.

### PR head resolution

Resolve **`shipHead`** once before Step 1. Do **not** rewrite `config.project.workingBranch`.

| Context | `shipHead` |
|---------|------------|
| `workflowMode: true` and readable `{us-dir}/*.state.md` | `state.branch` from workflow state frontmatter |
| Standalone `/ship-pr` (no workflow state) | explicit `head=` param when set, else `config.project.workingBranch` |

Use `shipHead` for the active-branch check (Step 1), conditional `git pull` (only when upstream exists — see Step 1), `git push -u`, and `create-pr --head`. When `workflowMode: true` and workflow state is unreadable or missing `state.branch`, STOP.

## Quality gate bypass (`skipQualityGates`)

See [`gates.md`](../ws-shared/gates.md) § Quality gate bypass. Ship/PREPARE row 5 nuances: [PREPARE-CHECKLIST.md](PREPARE-CHECKLIST.md) § 5. Safety floor (REFUTED) never bypassed.

## Steps

1. **Preflight**: resolve `shipHead` per § PR head resolution; resolve `baseBranch`/`gitRemote` and SCM provider (`providers.scm` in `config.json`); confirm active branch is `shipHead` (workflow: `state.branch`; standalone: `workingBranch` or explicit `head=`); check `git status` and tracking drift; **pull only when upstream exists** — after the active-branch check, run `git pull {gitRemote} {shipHead}` only when `git ls-remote --heads {gitRemote} {shipHead}` shows the ref. Do **not** trust `@{u}`: setup.md §5b option 2 creates the branch with `git checkout -b {name} {gitRemote}/{baseBranch} --no-track`, so `@{u}` either fails (no upstream) or, without `--no-track`, would resolve to the base and look like a first-push upstream. Always gate `git pull` on `git ls-remote --heads {gitRemote} {shipHead}`. If the remote ref is absent (first-push branch, e.g. new local `feat/{slug}` from bootstrap), **skip pull** and proceed to Step 4 `git push -u {gitRemote} {shipHead}`. If `ls-remote` fails for auth/network (not a missing ref), STOP and offer retry / cancel. Auto-detect base via `bash {skillsRoot}/ws-ship-pr/scripts/detect-base-branch.sh` if unset; stop on unexpected dirty files outside delivery scope.
   - Optional `fable` integration (safety floor — **never** bypassed by `skipQualityGates`): consume the normalized tri-state policy from the shared workflow runtime. `REFUTED` always stops delivery. `"caveats"` additionally stops on `VERIFIED WITH CAVEATS`; `false` and `"refuted"` preserve the REFUTED-only floor. Require remediation before pushing or creating a PR when blocked.
   - Done when: `shipHead`, `baseBranch`, and SCM provider resolved; active branch matches `shipHead`; working tree clean enough to ship; pulled **or skipped (no upstream)**.

2. **Prepare to PR (goal)**: load [PREPARE-CHECKLIST.md](PREPARE-CHECKLIST.md). Drive coverage → build → tests → security → **fable-judge verdict (row 5)** → **consumer prepare discovery** (row 6; scan local `AGENTS.md` / `{sharedDir}/AGENTS.md` / `rules.*` / ship docs for prepare or before-push/publish/deliver steps; **wait** until those obligations complete) until every required row is ✅/⏭. **Always show row 5** on the board; under `skipQualityGates` it may credit ⏭ for visibility only — **`REFUTED` still ❌ STOP** when `auditVerdictsBlockShip` applies. Show the board to the user after each item and before shipping. Credit orch Steps 6–7 only with cited evidence for the **current** tree. STOP on any ❌ — including unfinished discovered local prepare steps.
   - Done when: board shown; scan evidence recorded for row 6; all required rows ✅/⏭.

3. **Code-review loop**: skip if already reviewed under `ws-spec-to-pr` Step 6 or `ws-spec-to-pr-lite` Step 3 (record on board). Otherwise load [ws-code-review](../ws-code-review/SKILL.md) against `base` and run the fix → re-review loop for Critical/Warning (max 3 rounds; Pause on residual).
   - Done when: review clean, Pause after 3-iteration cap with residual documented, or skipped with evidence.

4. **Commit & push**: only after Step 2 is green. When performing a **delivery commit** of plan-dir artifacts (standalone `/ship-pr` or `workflowMode`), stage **only** paths resolved from `defaults.deliveryCommitArtifacts` per [`ARTIFACTS.md`](../ws-spec-to-pr/ARTIFACTS.md) § Step 8:
   - Read `{sharedDir}/config.json` → `defaults.deliveryCommitArtifacts`; missing object/keys merge to AC1 defaults (`includeRefinedPlan: true`, `includeDeliveryResult: false`, all opt-ins `false`).
   - When `includeRefinedPlan` is true: stage `step-02-{slug}.plan.refined.md` if present, else `step-01-{slug}.plan.md`; if **neither** exists → **STOP** with a clear error.
   - When `includeDeliveryResult` is false: do **not** `git add` `step-08-{slug}.result.md` (file may still exist / be written earlier for orch evidence).
   - Opt-in toggles (`includeSpec`, `includeCheckReport`, `includeCodeReview`, `includeTestingReport`): stage only when toggle is true **and** the file exists; otherwise skip and note on the prepare board / result prose.
   - If the resolved stage set is empty → **STOP** (no empty plan-artifact delivery commit).
   - Never invent missing artifact content. Product/source staging (`commit-code` / ship-scope product files) is unchanged and separate from this delivery set.
   - Commit message may say “configured delivery artifacts” (do not hardcode “plan and result”).
   Then commit remaining ship-scope changes (delivery commit may already exist under `workflowMode`); `git push -u {gitRemote} {shipHead}`. Skip push when `shipAction: skip` or `dry-run`.
   - Done when: branch pushed with no uncommitted ship-scope changes, or ship explicitly skipped.

5. **Create PR**: only when Step 2 is green and `shipAction: create-pr` (or standalone default). Resolve `providers.scm` per [`config-resolution.md`](../ws-shared/config-resolution.md) (`github` or `azure-devops` / `ado` only for create-pr; STOP if `local` or unresolved — do not invent a client). Load matching provider ([ws-github-provider](../ws-github-provider/SKILL.md) or [ws-azure-devops-provider](../ws-azure-devops-provider/SKILL.md)), `validate-auth` (STOP on failure), then `create-pr --head {shipHead} --base {baseBranch}` (reuse open PR for same head→base when present). Capture PR id and URL. When workflow state or spec frontmatter has tracker `id`, dispatch provider **`comment-issue`** (alias `close-loop`) with PR URL + one-paragraph summary (`dry-run` when parent is dry-run). Skip when `id` is null / `source: local`.
   - Done when: PR id/URL captured or reused; close-loop dispatched or skipped with reason. If `stopBeforeFixPr` and `shipAction: create-pr`: print URL and STOP (success).

6. **Monitor reviews & converge**: skip if `stopBeforeFixPr` (orch Step 9 owns [ws-goal-fix-pr](../ws-goal-fix-pr/SKILL.md)). Otherwise, after pushing and creating PR, wait **30 seconds** (wait for code-review action / CI workflows to start on SCM infrastructure), then start [ws-goal-fix-pr](../ws-goal-fix-pr/SKILL.md) (default **300 seconds** heartbeat/settle loop, [GOAL-OVERRIDES.md](GOAL-OVERRIDES.md)), poll required checks via provider **`check-pr-status`** (classify diff-regression vs baseline vs infra-flake; one flake rerun; baseline does not block merge only when reproduced on default branch and recorded) and `list-threads` via the configured SCM provider, and dispatch `ws-goal-fix-pr` until `activeThreads == 0` or `max`. Never merge while threads remain, checks are red, or on escalate-stop. Prepare the handoff prompt/state for `ws-goal-fix-pr` even when stopping early so Step 9 can resume cleanly.
   - Done when: `activeThreads == 0` and required checks green, or run stopped with PR URL reported.

7. **Merge**: only when Step 6 converged and checks green. Configured SCM provider intent `merge-pr`; skip when `no-merge` or `stopBeforeFixPr`. When merge runs in-session and tracker `id` is present, dispatch **`comment-issue`** again (merged follow-up). Never delete the resolved PR head (`shipHead`: workflow `state.branch`; standalone `workingBranch` or explicit `head=`).
   - Done when: merged via configured SCM provider or explicitly skipped; `shipHead` intact.

8. **Telemetry aggregate** (post-delivery, non-blocking): after successful ship completion — PR created (`stopBeforeFixPr` / workflow Step 8 handoff), merge done (standalone or full convergence), or `shipAction: skip` with workflow delivery marked complete — run `node bin/generate-telemetry-aggregate.cjs` (writes `{plansDir}/telemetry/aggregate.json`). When `stopBeforeFixPr`, orchestrator Step 9 also runs this after `ws-goal-fix-pr` convergence (idempotent). On failure: **warn and continue** — do not block ship, merge, or PR handoff.
   - Done when: aggregate script ran or failure warned; delivery outcome already reported.

## Runtime audit (`defaults.enableAuditing`)

When `config.json` → `defaults.enableAuditing` resolves to `true` (see [`config-resolution.md`](../ws-shared/config-resolution.md)), follow [`ws-audit`](../ws-audit/SKILL.md):
- **Inherit or Init:** in workflow mode, inherit the active orchestrator audit session (`{us-dir}`); in standalone mode, initialize a session under `{plansDir}/ship-{shipHead}`.
- **Catch script errors:** whenever any script or helper (`detect-base-branch.sh`, `verify.sh`, provider scripts `fix_pr_azure_context.py` / `fetch_threads.cjs` / `resolve_thread.cjs`, SCM CLI commands, or telemetry scripts) fails or exits non-zero, append a finding (`category: "script"`, `severity: "error"`).
- **Finalize & gate:** when running standalone, finalize the audit session at completion/stop and present the upstream issue gate if errors occurred.

## Output

```markdown
**PR:** {provider-returned-url}
```

In `dry-run`, `push-only`, `skip`, or early `stopBeforeFixPr` stop, state the outcome clearly (no placeholder URL). Always include the final Prepare to PR board in the closing summary. When `skipQualityGates` is active, prefix the closing summary with **`[GATES BYPASSED]`**.

## Subagent contract

- Treat prepare checks, SCM authorization, and Fable safety policy as hard boundaries.
- Stage only explicitly configured delivery artifacts and assigned product paths.
- Stop before any external mutation unless the caller supplied the selected ship intent.
- Return the prepare board, resulting refs/URL when applicable, and unresolved blockers.
- Never weaken REFUTED handling or infer approval from cancellation.

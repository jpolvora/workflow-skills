# Gabarito

Operational communication skill for Cursor agents: ten directives plus style discipline.

## What it does

- Runs **every turn** (always-on) unless opted out
- Improves accountability, anti-sycophancy, clarification, verification, and prose quality
- First reply only: short signal line (*"Gabarito in use."*)

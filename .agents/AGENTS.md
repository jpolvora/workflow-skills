# AGENTS.md — Packaged Skills Index

This folder contains skills developed for consumers. Clients install them via the installer (`npx github:jpolvora/workflow-skills` or the local CLI script).

Skills under `.agents/skills/` are used by:

- **Project workflows** — especially `spec-to-pr` and its pipeline dependencies (`00`–`11`, providers)
- **Local verification** — the `test/` consumer tree (install/pack dry-runs)

This file is a **brief index / routing table** for skills shipped in this package. It can also serve as a **template** for an `AGENTS.md` (or `.agents/AGENTS.md`) skill index in consumer projects after install.

> **Source hub:** The canonical harness hub for *this* repository (layers, skill loading, verification, site catalog) remains the root [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md). Prefer that file when editing the upstream harness. Prefer *this* file when documenting what ships under `.agents/skills/` for consumers.

> **Drift check:** After adding/removing/renaming skills under `.agents/skills/`, update **both** root `AGENTS.md` (hub + site catalog) and this packaged index so consumer-facing tables stay aligned.

**Language:** All skill content and pipeline output remain **en-us**.

## Rules for skills under `skills/` (`.agents/skills/*`)

These rules apply to **every** skill shipped in this package (pipeline, providers, review, utility). They mirror the portability and integrity expectations enforced by [`check-harness`](skills/check-harness/SKILL.md).

### Portability and genericity (mandatory)

1. **Portable and project-agnostic** — Skills must work in any consumer repo. Do **not** hardcode org/repo names, solution filenames, API hosts, tenant fields, or stack-specific build/test commands inside skill bodies or scripts.
2. **Customize via `config.json`** — Project identity, stack, verification commands, issue trackers, and `providers.active` / `providers.scm` live in `skills/spec-to-pr/config.json` (gitignored; copy from `config.json.example`). Skills **read** config / `STACK.md` / `tools.md`; they do not embed consumer metadata.
3. **Repo-root-relative paths only** — References use paths like `skills/01-write-plan/SKILL.md` or `.agents/skills/...` from the consumer root. **Forbidden:** absolute paths (`C:\Users\...`, `/home/...`) or author-machine dependencies.
4. **Progressive disclosure** — Route via this index / root hub; do not paste entire skill bodies into hubs. Prefer links to the canonical skill over duplicated prose.
5. **No `name:` collisions** — Each `SKILL.md` frontmatter `name:` must be unique across the installed tree.
6. **Evidence-based harness changes** — When fixing routing/links, cite verified paths; do not invent files.
7. **Consistent skill and task folder references** — References to tasks, steps, and subagent skills in all workflow files must match the exact, prefixed skill folder names (e.g. `05-verify-plan`, `07-integration-validation`, `10-update-plan-implementation`). Unprefixed, retired, or placeholder folder references are forbidden.

### Language (mandatory)

- All skill bodies, frontmatter, scripts (user-facing strings), gates, banners, Progress Board text, and generated artifact templates: **English (en-us)**.
- No Portuguese (PT-BR) in skill content. Conversational replies to a user may follow the user’s language when the project allows it; **skill files stay en-us**.

### Upstream ownership and consumer edits

| Role | Rule |
|------|------|
| **Canonical upstream** | [`jpolvora/workflow-skills`](https://github.com/jpolvora/workflow-skills) is the authoritative source for pipeline and dependency skills. |
| **Installed copies** | Skills under `.agents/skills/` in consumer projects are **managed copies**. A plain `update` **overwrites** skill files (except preserved `config.json`). |
| **Local edits** | Consumers **may** edit skills locally for experiments, but those changes **can be lost** on the next `npx github:jpolvora/workflow-skills update` (or `update --include-new`). |
| **Contribute back** | Lasting improvements must be authored against the upstream repo and submitted as a **pull request** to `jpolvora/workflow-skills` (prefer `develop` → `main`). Do not treat a consumer fork of skill files as the long-term source of truth. |

### Pre-merge gate: `check-harness` (mandatory for upstream)

Before committing skill changes and before merging to **`main`** on `workflow-skills`:

1. Load and run [`skills/check-harness/SKILL.md`](skills/check-harness/SKILL.md) (Phases 0–5c scan → Phase 6 correction plan → Phase 7 only with approval).
2. The audit **must** cover at least: routing vs disk inventory, broken/relative links, absolute paths, redundancy / progressive disclosure, **portability** (no hardcoded project metadata; parameterization via `config.json` / stack docs), and **en-us** compliance.
3. Do **not** merge skill PRs to `main` while critical harness findings remain open.
4. After harness-affecting changes, also regenerate the site catalog when applicable (`node bin/build-site.js` in the upstream repo) and keep root `AGENTS.md` + this packaged index in sync (**Drift check** above).

Standalone invoke: `/check-harness` or `@check-harness` (optional `--dry-run` for report-only).

## Workflows

| Skill | Path | Role |
|-------|------|------|
| `spec-to-pr` | `skills/spec-to-pr/SKILL.md` | Spec → plan → implement → verify → review → integrate → PR (FSM F0–F6, steps 0–13) |
| `spec-to-pr-lite` | `skills/spec-to-pr-lite/SKILL.md` | Fast, sequential Plan → implement → review → ship PR (steps 1–5) |

### Dual-Mode Execution & Compatibility

Both workflows co-exist cleanly in **dual mode** inside consumer projects:
- **Shared Configuration**: They share `.agents/skills/shared/config.json` as a single source of truth. If the local `spec-to-pr-lite/config.json` is missing, lite orchestrators and tools automatically fall back to standard.
- **State Isolation**: Workflows write a `workflowType` field (`standard` / `lite`) to their state files. Resume discovery filters these to prevent cross-resuming standard/lite workflows.
- **Pipeline Reusability**: They share the same underlying pipeline skills (`01-write-plan`, `04-implement-tasks`, `06-code-review`, `11-ship-pr`), making dual-mode execution lightweight, coherent, and efficient.

## Consumer notes

- Installed skill trees are **managed upstream copies**. `config.json` is preserved on update; skill files are not.
- To refresh from upstream: `npx github:jpolvora/workflow-skills update` (add `--include-new` when new top-level skill folders appeared upstream).
- Consumers may copy or adapt this index into their own root `AGENTS.md`; keep paths relative to the install root (typically `.agents/skills/...`).
- **Dual hub (OK):** consumer root `AGENTS.md` may stay project-specific and delegate skill routing to `.cursor/rules/index.mdc` (or equivalent). This packaged `.agents/AGENTS.md` remains the **skill catalog** for the installed hub; keep both aligned after updates.
- **Do not** rely on in-place edits to pipeline skills in a consumer project for production workflows — prefer an upstream PR (see **Upstream ownership** above). In-place edits are overwritten on update.
- Before upstream merge to `main`, skill changes must pass **`check-harness`** (see **Pre-merge gate** above).
- Guardrails resolution: see root [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) § **External Dependencies** (`rules.seniorDeveloper` / `rules.karpathyGuidelines` in config).

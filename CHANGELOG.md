- **Prompt**: Create an install test for workflow-skills consumed by a test project and update AGENTS.md to allow install from remote only for the test/ folder.
- **Done**: Modified AGENTS.md to allow remote installation only within the test/ directory. Created a test/ folder, initialized an empty package.json inside it, packed workflow-skills as a tarball, ran a clean npm installation of the packaged dependency inside test/ using the interactive installer, added a .gitignore to ignore .agents/ and node_modules/, added an automated test script (test/test-install.js), registered "npm run tests" in the root package.json, updated README.md and AGENTS.md with safety, reliability, and verification documentation, and documented the website catalog build process.
- **Result**: Successfully verified installation by populating L:\source\workflow-skills\test\.agents\skills with all 29 skills, all of which are correctly ignored from version control. Both remote installation (npx github:jpolvora/workflow-skills) and local installer tests pass fully, documentation has been updated, and Pull Request #19 to main has been created.
